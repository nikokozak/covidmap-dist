# Dockerized SARS-COV-2 Tracker (Chile)

### What do I do?

This is a quick and dirty project I undertook to get familiarized with Docker and data-scraping in Python.

### Play with me

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

Will start two services: a nginx server mapped to port 80 of your computer (http://localhost/), along with a Python scraper running a `sched` loop.

Simply open up localhost on a browser and you'll see the page.

### How do I work?

Two Docker containers are fired up by Docker-compose: a `server` container, and a `scraper` container. 

Every 5 minutes, the `scraper` consumes data from the Chilean Ministry of Science's Github repo, where somewhat up-to-date COVID stats are kept. 

The `scraper` and `server` containers share a volume, where the `scraper` writes json files.

The `scraper` is written in Python relying heavily on pandas for data wrangling. The `server` is an nginx process rerouting some URI's to the json files generated by the `scraper`.

The website is built with Vuejs, and compiled to production status using the Vue CLI.
